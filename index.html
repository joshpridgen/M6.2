        <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
        <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum 
          has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
          took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
          only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
          unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
          Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
          including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

          <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
          <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
            of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
            a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
            Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
            word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
            sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
            Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
            popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
            comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
          </p>
          <p>
            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. 
            Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced 
            in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

        <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a 
          page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
          normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look 
          like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum 
          as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in 
          their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on 
          purpose (injected humour and the like).
        </p>
      
        <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered 
          alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly 
          believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't 
          anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet 
          tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. 
          It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, 
          to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free 
          from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
